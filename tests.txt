Since the functionality of MapCU is limited to only a couple of different pages and operations, we opted
for manual testing currently. We conducted tests for:

Log in:
1. Starting from the log in page, we ensured that the user could create an account and log in with it. 
(sometimes this takes a long time to perform. The user is created in the Heroku Database, but the response
is heavily delayed and sometimes times out. When doing this operation another time, this delay 
is not present. Most likely Heroku temporaring storing away some resources when the routes aren't accessed for 
a long time)
---if the user is creating an account that already exists, the user is informed

2. If the user tries to login with an account that doesn't exist, they are not granted access and are informed
of incorrect credentials

3. If the user tries to hit another page before logging in, they are redirected to the login page

4. The user is not allowed to create a user with an empty username or password field. 

Home page: 
1. All buttons have the correct action, whether its switching pages, submitting form, or logging out, in which
the logout will bring the user back to the beginning and make he/she log in again

2. If user attempts to input invalid rooms or information, they are informed saying that those inputs don't exist

3. If user inputs valid rooms, they are correctly brought to the instructions page, where the instruction is listed
(works for rooms that are far apart, or rooms that are right next to each other

Maps page:
1. Clicking on any of the buttons to display a map will render the map of that wing underneath. 

2. Clicking on MapCU logo at the top will bring the user back home, and logout button still logs them out.


General:
1. Submitting empty form does not crash anything, instead the user is informed that they should input in something else
